This contains *most* of the files for the game. The file that is missing is the lake because it is bigger than 25mb but I include
a duplicate of the baby duck so hopefully the game will still compile and run.

A youtube playthrough exists here: youtube.com/video/QXaMRL25Adc


wasd / left joystick: move and turn
mouse / right joystick: move camera
space / PS X / Xbox A: Jump/ Double Jump / Glide / Fall
Shift / L1 / L2: Run
R / Select: restart

Problems that exist: The final cutscene only works if you restart the game manually.
The cutscene only plays in the small window such that increasing the size of window will not scale the video sadly
